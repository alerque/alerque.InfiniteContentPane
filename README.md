### alerque.InfiniteContentPane

(Formerly dojox.layout.InfiniteContentPane -- renamed no make it easier to use
until such a time as it actually gets into the upstream tree.)

An **infinite scrolling content pane** for the dojo toolkit inspired by (but
not copied from) Paul Irish's [Infinite Scroll jQeruy plugin][piis].

* Extends dojox.layout.ContentPane with scroll detection and callbacks for
  fetching, placing and parsing extended data.
* Uses user supplied function such as dojo.xhrGet for fetcher.
